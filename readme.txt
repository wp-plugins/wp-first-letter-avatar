Set custom avatars for users with no Gravatar. The avatar will be the first (or any other) letter of user's name on a colorful background.

== Description ==

WP First Letter Avatar **sets custom avatars for users without Gravatar**. The avatar will be a first letter of the user's name. You can also configure the plugin to use any other letter to set custom avatar.

WP First Letter Avatar includes a set of **beautiful, colorful letter avatars** in many sizes. Optimal size will be chosen by the plugin in order to display high quality avatar and not download, for example, big 512px avatars when only 48px is needed... **PSD template** for avatar is also included.

You can also create your own avatar set by creating new directory next to *'default'* folder and following the naming convention from *'default'*. 

By default, custom avatar will be set only to users without Gravatars, but you can change that in settings and not use Gravatar at all.

WP First Letter Avatar helps you **bring more colors** into your blog. Plus, your readers will be more **willing to comment on your posts**, since they can actually relate to these avatars much better than to Mystery Person.

All images were compressed using the fantastic [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/), so avatars are **incredibly light and ultra-high quality**.

WP First Letter Avatar is also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Dev49net/wp-first-letter-avatar).
